# Modelling Human Behavior
This repository is about modelling human behavior change during influenza outbreak using SEIRV model. There are two groups: risk averse and risk tolerant. The risk averse group will wear a mask as the prevalence increases while risk tolerant group will never wear a mask. There is interraction/ mixing of individuals from the two groups.
